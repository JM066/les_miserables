# Les Misérables Character Network Visualization

A simple React-based network visualization of character relationships from Victor Hugo's *Les Misérables* *(work in progress)*. This project analyzes character importance through directional influence mapping using an influence-based graph layout that prioritizes how characters affect others.

## 🎭 About

This visualization represents characters from *Les Misérables* as nodes in a network graph, where character importance is calculated through **directional influence analysis** rather than bidirectional connections. This visualization recognizes that influence flows in one direction: when a person affects someone's life, that person may influence others, creating a cascade effect that measures person's true reach and importance in the story.

- **Node size** reflects character importance 
- **Node color** represents different character groups/communities
- **Links** show directional relationships between characters (A influences B, not necessarily vice versa)
